# Environments

Environments are logical partitions for Unity Gaming Services that contain data associated with your project.
Examples can include game code using Cloud Code, or game configurations using Remote Config.

All users are provided with a default environment, the `production` environment.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't delete the default environment.

For more information, including how to create an environment, refer to [Unity Environments](https://docs.unity.com/ugs-overview/en/manual/service-environments).
