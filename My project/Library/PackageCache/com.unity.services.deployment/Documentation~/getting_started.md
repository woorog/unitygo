## Project setup
Before using the deployment package make sure that your project is properly set up.

1. Install the Deployment package (com.unity.services.deployment) using the Unity Package Manager. Learn more about [adding and removing](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-actions.html) packages.
1. In the Unity Editor toolbar go to: 
    -  on `2021.3+`: **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Services**  
    -  on `2022+`: **Services** > **General Settings** > **Services**
1. Create a Unity Project ID or link to an existing one.
1. Switch to **Services** > **Deployment** tab and select the [environment](./environments.md) you want to work in.
1. Install a [supported package](./index.md#supported-packages). This is required to be able to create deployable assets.

## Access the Deployment window
To open the [Deployment window](./deployment_window.md), in the Editor toolbar go to:

- on `2021.3+`: **Window** > **Deployment**
- on `2022+`: **Services** > **Deployment**

## Create deployable assets
The Deployment package doesn't provide the ability to create deployable assets. For this, refer to the documentation of the supported package you intend to use.

<a name="select-assets"></a>
## Select assets
To select assets in the [Deployment window](./deployment_window.md), you can:

* Select the checkbox of an asset.
* Select the checkbox of a deployment definition to select all assets under that deployment definition.

<a name="deploy-assets"></a>
## Deploy assets
When you have installed a supported package and created a deployable asset, the Deployment window displays your deployable assets. 

You can deploy assets:

* Manually in the Deployment window
* Automatically on Play

### Deploy assets in the Deployment window

You can deploy assets manually in the Deployment window in the following ways:

* Double-click an asset.
* Right-click an asset and select **Deploy**.
* Select **Deploy All**.
* Select assets and select **Deploy Selected**.

> [!NOTE]
> When you deploy a Deployment Definition, all of its assets are deployed.

### Deploy assets automatically on Play

To deploy assets automatically on Play:

1. In the Deployment window, select the assets to deploy automatically.
1. Select the **More** (&#8942;) menu.
1. Ensure the **Deploy Selected On Play** is toggled on.

Now, when you enter Play Mode in the Editor, the selected assets are deployed.

<a name="group-assets"></a>
## Group assets
To group assets you need to use a [Deployment Definition](./deployment_definition.md). If no deployment definition is present, everything is grouped under a single `Default` deployment definition.
