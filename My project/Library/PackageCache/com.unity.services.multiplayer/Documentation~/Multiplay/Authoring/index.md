# Multiplay Hosting Authoring
This module allows users to author, modify, and deploy Multiplay Hosting assets directly from the Unity Editor.

> NOTE: Multiplay Hosting Authoring is only supported on Unity 2021.3 and above.

### Deployment Window
The Deployment Window is a core feature of the Deployment package.

The purpose of the Deployment Window is to allow all services
to have a single cohesive interface for Deployment needs.

The Deployment Window provides a uniform deployment interface for all services. It allows you to upload cloud assets for your respective cloud service.

For more information, consult the [com.unity.services.deployment](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.services.deployment@latest) package documentation.

### Create Multiplay Hosting Assets
Right-click in the Project Window then select `Create > Services > Multiplay Config` to create a Multiplay Hosting config file.

The Deployment Window automatically detects these files to be deployed at a later time.

For more information on how to create and modify Multiplay Hosting Assets, please see the [Multiplay Hosting assets](./multiplay-assets.md) documentation.
